   <h3 id="heading">Here are some things Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek discovered:</h3>
    <ul><li>Leeuwenhoek was one of the first to conduct experiments on himself. It was from his finger that blood was drawn for examination, and he placed pieces of his skin under a microscope, examining its structure in various parts of the body, and counting the number of vessels that permeate it.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Both Marcello Malpighi and Jan Swammerdam saw these structures before Leeuwenhoek, but Leeuwenhoek was the first to recognize what they are: red blood cells.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Infusoria (protists in modern zoological classification), in 1674
        In 1675, he was studying a variety of minerals, especially salts, and parts of plants and animals.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The vacuole of the cell in 1676</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Spermatozoa, in <strong>1677</strong></li></ul>
    <ul><li>The banded pattern of muscular fibers, in 1682</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Bacteria, (e.g., large Selenomonads from the human mouth), in 1683</li></ul>
    <ul><li>It seems he used horseradish to find out what causes irritation on the tongue.He used the effect of vinegar.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Leeuwenhoek diligently began to search for his animalcules.He found them everywhere: in rotten water, in ditches, on his own teeth. "Although I am now fifty years old," he wrote to the Royal Society, "my teeth are well preserved, because I am in the habit of rubbing them with salt every morning." He described paradontitis.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>In <strong>1684</strong> he published his research on the ovary.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>In 1687, Van Leeuwenhoek reported his research on the coffee bean.He roasted the bean, cut it into slices and saw a spongy interior. The bean was pressed, and an oil appeared. He boiled the coffee with rain water twice and set it aside.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Leeuwenhoek corresponded regularly with Anthonie Heinsius, the Delft pensionary in the States of Holland and in 1687 member of the board of the Delft chamber of the VOC.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>In 1696 Nicolaas Witsen sent him a map of Tartary and ore found near the Amur in Siberia.[60]</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Van Leeuwenhoek has been recognized as the first person to use a histological stain to color specimens observed under the microscope using saffron.He used this technique only once.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>In 1702 he requested a book on Peruvian silver mines in Potos√≠.</li></ul>
